preamps stages with caps on feedback are actually opamp integrators
without the cap the gain becomes 1 at 400kHz - 4Mhz GBP / 10x gain - this is where 20db/decade slops hist 0db
the cap sets 3db point, i.e. the freq where slope starts
until that freq the gain is ~ 10x (resistors ratio)
200pF caps with 100k feedback resistor gives 
1/(2*pi*Rf*Cf) = 1/(2*pi*10e3*200e-12) = 80kHz
opamp tau = RC = 2us => can detect 10us targets


=>  If you only want to detect a 1us target then shoot for a 200ns tau. 
i.e 20pF Cf
May be change capc 200pF -> 20pF
